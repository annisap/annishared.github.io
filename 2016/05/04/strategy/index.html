            <p>Strategy is a highly-valued world heard everywhere from entering in a master curriculum to conducting any new business venture since real life is a game of strategy with the top priority be to master where your time goes. But what actually means to have a good strategy?<br>Knowing and improving your mental powers is where every strategy begins and ends. As written in the thought-provoking book “The art of the war” if you know the enemy and know yourself, you can give a hundred battles and win all of them. Because of the controversial meaning of the word “enemy” I could clear it by using only two Nietzsche phrases</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must be proud of your enemy: then the success of your enemy shall be your success too.<br>But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would say that a good strategy depends on being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses always adaptable to a context of achieving a major aim where every obstacle you meet is an enemy that you should admire as in the end it will only make you stronger.<br>A business strategy doesn’t adopt different values than the personal one. To have a good strategy you should always ask yourself what should I do so as to succeed in the market; and afterwards try to doubt the answers. Responding to this question you should have a bird eye view of what’s happening around the world and then understand the whole environment in detail so as to draw the best possible way for success. In this endeavor you should have in mind that high achievements always takes place in a framework of high expectations. To me, a great strategic mind is <a href="http://fundersandfounders.com/how-elon-musk-started/" target="_blank" rel="external">Elon Musk</a> who saw opportunities into the plunge of darkness while everyone saw just blackness and failure. An entrepreneur should take risks without fearing of falling apart because even if one fails should gain experience and the second time he tries he surely be more near in the goal than the first time. Many people believe that this is the way to build your own luck, by leaving the confront zone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/07/elon-musks-patent-decision-reflects-three-strategic-truths/" target="_blank" rel="external">“Activity focus” is the new strategic focus.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different types of strategy at different levels within your organization that I tried to illustrated in the below infographic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Corporate Strategy<br>An organization with different business units should foster communication and corporation so as to support one goal as a whole.</li>
<li>Business Units Strategy<br>Each business unit independently should deliberate how they can win in their own markets but always without causing harm to the corporate strategy</li>
<li>Functional Strategy<br>Each team in the business unit should have its own goals and always having in ming how these goals will help the longer plans of the business.</li>
</ol>
